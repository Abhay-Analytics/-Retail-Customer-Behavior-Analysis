# Retail-Customer-Behavior-Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer behavior using point-of-sale (POS) data from a retail store. The dataset includes information such as customer transactions, purchase history, product details, and timestamps. By leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we will uncover valuable insights into customer purchasing patterns, popular products, peak shopping hours, and customer segmentation. These insights will help the retail store make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer engagement initiatives.


Data Availability 

The data set we will be using for this exercise comprises of 3 tables: 

--> Customer: Customer demographics 

--> Transactions: Customer transaction details 

--> Product category: Product category and sub category information
